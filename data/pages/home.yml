  title: '"I feel uncomfortable in coworking spaces"'
story: >
  You're not alone. They can be...


  - So sterile the space looks it’s best without people in it, you may as well
  be working in a car showroom.

  - So busy you rarely recognise anyone, you may as well be working at
  Starbucks.

  - So pretentious you always feel out of place, you may as well be working in
  the lobby of a Trump hotel.

  - So quiet, nobody ever talks to you, you may as well be working at the
  library.

  - So loud, you can’t hear yourself think, you may as well be working at a
  football match.

  - So empty, you feel more isolated than before you arrived, you may as well
  have stayed at home.

  - So cramped, you have to get up early to get the best seat, you may as well
  be sitting on a bus.

  - So impersonal, you feel like you’re just another bum on a seat, you may as
  well order the cheapest thing on the menu at a posh restaurant and spend the
  day there.

  - So joyless, you feel awkward even making eye contact with other members, you
  may as well be sat in a doctors waiting room.

  - So regulated, you’re constantly worried about breaking rules, you may as
  well have joined the navy.
